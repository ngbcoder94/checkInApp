# checkInApp
I am wanting to create a robust app for my work. More details in the read me:)

Hello!! Welcome to my checkInApp repo, I have created this to try and solve a simple problem. At work, We are constantly, throwing parties and having people check in. The problem is, they do this by hand haha. So here is my solution to their problem. 

Idea, simple.... two windows: Window A) landing page, Enter your name and .csv/excel. Press "run" to start the program and takes you to Window B. Window B) secondary page, prompts user to enter their name and then gives a green check symbol if the user is on the list or a red X symbol if the user is not.
